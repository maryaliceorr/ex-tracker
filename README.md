# Ex Tracker

 ## Description
Upon arriving on this page, the application should include a picture of my ex with details about him and there should be cards printed out of locations in which he frequents. There should also be a search bar where you can search for location cards where he frequents and there should buttons that display location cards based on the time of day when he frequents the locations (morning, afternoon, evening and after dark). There should also be a reset button that resets the page with all original location cards.
